Could you stop  the same processes before starting Frontend and Backend in External Powershell Windows. 
So that they are running independently without interfering. I would like to do manually testing.Tks!

I'll stop any running backend and frontend processes, then provide you with commands to start them fresh in separate PowerShell windows for manual testing. 

Ran terminal command: Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -match 'dotnet|node'} | Select-Object ProcessName, Id, @{Name='StartTime';Expression={$_.StartTime}} | Format-Table

Found 3 running processes. Let me stop them: 

Ran terminal command: Stop-Process -Id 15500, 20040, 10352 -Force ; Start-Sleep -Seconds 2 ; Write-Host "✅ All processes stopped. Ready to restart."

Perfect! ✅ All processes stopped. Now use these commands in two separate external PowerShell windows:

**Window 1 - Backend (ASP.NET Core):**
```powershell
cd 'D:\Git\VueChenClan\BulkyWeb'
dotnet run
```

**Window 2 - Frontend (Vue 3):**
```powershell
cd 'D:\Git\VueChenClan\vue-frontend'
npm run dev
```

**Expected Results:**
- Backend: Runs on `https://localhost:7017` (or similar secure port)
- Frontend: Runs on `http://localhost:5173`

**For Testing:**
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login with: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
3. All CRUD operations should work independently

The processes are now fresh and won't interfere with each other. Ready for your manual testing! 🚀
