Here are tips for rephrasing your prompts for better results:

1. Be Specific

❌ "Fix the bug"
✅ "The login page shows a 400 error when I enter credentials. The backend expects 'email' but frontend sends 'username'. Fix the mismatch."
2. Include Context

❌ "Add a feature"
✅ "Add a logout button to the navbar that clears the auth token and redirects to login"
3. State the Current Problem

❌ "Doesn't work"
✅ "The customer dashboard doesn't show the sidebar menu after login. I see the logout button but no navigation items."
4. Describe Expected Outcome

❌ "Make it better"
✅ "After logging in as admin, I should see: Admin menu section with 'Activity Management', 'Position Management', and 'System Management' categories"
5. Use Action Verbs

✅ "Fix", "Add", "Update", "Remove", "Create", "Debug", "Verify"
❌ Vague terms like "improve", "make better", "check"
6. Provide Error Messages

✅ "Error: 'Failed to load resource: 400 (Bad Request)' in console when logging in"
❌ "Something's wrong"
7. Break Complex Requests into Steps

❌ "Set up everything"
✅
"Step 1: Create a Dockerfile for the Vue app"
"Step 2: Build the Docker image"
"Step 3: Push to Azure Container Registry"
8. Give Examples

✅ "Change the login redirect: Admin → /app/admin, Customer → /app/customer"
❌ "Fix routing"
Your Good Prompts (Examples):

✅ "when login admin/customer, I don't see logout button and no respective permission menu."
✅ "In 5173, I see... Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400"
✅ "please start frontend and backend in two external powershells. (stop the same processes before start them)"
These are clear because they include: what, where, the problem, and what you see.

What does this 'Sorry, the response hit the length limit' mean?

"Sorry, the response hit the length limit" means:

The AI has generated a response that exceeds the maximum token/character limit allowed in a single message. This typically happens when:

Very Long Explanations - The response tries to explain too much detail at once
Multiple Code Blocks - Large amounts of code or multiple files shown together
Comprehensive Answers - Trying to cover all aspects of a complex topic in one response
File Contents - Reading and displaying large files entirely
How to avoid this:

✅ Ask focused questions - Instead of "explain everything about Vue," ask "how do I use v-if in Vue?"
✅ Request specific sections - Instead of "show me the entire auth flow," ask "explain the login function in authStore.ts"
✅ Break it into steps - Instead of one big request, use multiple smaller requests
✅ Be specific about what you need - "Show me just the error handling part" vs "show me everything"
Example:

❌ Too broad: "Explain the entire Vue project structure and how everything works together"

✅ Better: "What's in the src/stores directory and why do we need Pinia?"

✅ Even better: "Show me the authStore.ts file and explain the login function"

In your case with this project, if you get that error, try:

Ask about one component at a time
Request fixes for one issue at a time
Ask for specific code sections, not entire files
